        # :method_missing errors to allow syntax flexibility for paragraph-type
        # models.  The issue is the syntax format of those models--the way we pass
        # the content value as a special argument--coupled with the model's
        # ability to accept nested instructions.
        #
        # By ignoring method missing errors here, we can pass the entire paragraph
        # block in the initial, built-in call to :text.
